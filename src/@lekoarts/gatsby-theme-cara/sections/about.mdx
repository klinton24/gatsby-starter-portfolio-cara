## About

### I love coding, so why not get paid doing what I love?

I'm seeking an entry-level position web development position, utilizing skills and knowledge of a variety of programming languages.

I love working with React and all the things it entails like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My future endeavors include working on more projects involving Node.js, Socket.IO, and Material-UI. I have the ability to learn quickly, a team driven personality, and the desire to constantly improve.
